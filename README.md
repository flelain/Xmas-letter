# Xmas-letter
I'm not quite sure why I named this "Xmas letter" because it's not a letter at all :) It's a quick Python script to automatically draw who's gonna offer a gift to whom around the Christmas at night on Dec. 24 :)

You provide a list of persons taking part to this fun activity, with their emails and some kind of "affinity" -rather "anti-affinity" actually in the end- in the "family" field: people from a same "family" can't offer gifts between each other (between the 2 persons of a couple for instance). Once drawing is done, an email is sent to everyone with the name of the person he/she has to find a gift for, to be offered on Dec. 24.

Email sending part not done yet!!
